## Stage 1: Initial Idea and Functional Code
**Date:** February 13,2025
The initial idea was to create a desktop search engine inspired by the computer's built-in search bar but enhanced with AI-powered results ranking and better search capabilities.  
The first version of the program was functional but disorganized, focusing solely on implementing basic search functionality using SerpAPI.

Key Features at This Stage:
1. Basic Google search functionality via SerpAPI.
2. A simple graphical interface using Tkinter.
3. Local storage of search history in JSON.

## Stage 2: Prototype Uploaded
**Date:** April 3, 2025
The functional prototype was uploaded to GitHub. It included:
- A working graphical interface.
- Search history functionality.
- Basic error handling for API requests.

This version was shared to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

## Stage 3: Code Refinement and Multilingual Support
**Date:** April 10, 2025
The code was organized and optimized for readability and maintainability. Additional improvements were made:
1. **Multilingual Support:** The program now supports both English and Spanish, making it accessible to a broader audience.
2. **Markdown Documentation:** The `README.md` file and supporting documentation were written in English to standardize the project's presentation.

These changes were aimed at improving the user experience and preparing the project for public use.

## Next Steps
1. Explore integrating cloud storage for search history and configuration.
2. Consider adding AI-based search result recommendations.
3. Improve error handling and performance optimizations.
